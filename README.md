# logica-computacional
repository destined for my studies on computational logic, at SESI Brazil on the conduct of professor Eduardo Hernandes.

So far I have learned the following topics:
  
  -1°(24/07/2024) the teacher presented us with a website called "https://compute-it.toxicode.fr/" in which we learned the basic concept of computational logic in a more approximate way with a game

  -2°(24/07/2024) the teacher taught us a little more programming logic through a new type of semi-code called "Portugol" it is a simple language that suits my native language "Portuguese", two files were posted in the repository representing what was learned
